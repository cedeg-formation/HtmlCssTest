                    on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at
                    a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant

                    Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.
